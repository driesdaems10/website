abstract: This book provides an encompassing overview of the origins and development of social complexity and its future as a core concept for studying the past. The book offers a wide-ranging conceptual perspective on the role of social complexity in human societies, its origins, development and loss in societal complexity trajectories on multiple temporal and spatial scales. The core of the book is formed by an extensive theoretical and conceptual model of complexity dynamics. This model offers a concise set of prepositions from which a powerful theoretical framework is constructed that provides an encompassing view on the role and functionality of social complexity in human societies in the past. The book offers an in-depth perspective on the study of social complexity in archaeology, however, the approach is inherently transdisciplinary in nature as it integrates approaches derived from complex systems thinking, archaeological theory, social practice theory, and sustainability and resilience science. The theoretical part is supplemented with a practical application of the model onto specific examples of long-term complexity trajectories in archaeological case studies. The objective of the book is to provide a discipline-wide resource relevant for researchers and students across the field of archaeology, as well as to transcend disciplinary boundaries in its approach and appeal. In order to obtain this intended general utility, the topic is presented in a clear form as to be accessible for researchers as well as undergraduate and graduate students.
