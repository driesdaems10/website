subtitle: Opinion piece on the future after COVID-19 for the "Call for Inspiration" from the Jonge Academie. To be published in Maja.
summary: Our world has been hit in its very core. The connectivity that so characterises our modern world, is also one of the drivers of the pandamic that wanders through our society. Can we rethink this connectivity in a way that it addresses this brave new world? And can we use a historical lens to aid this rethinking?

The Covid-19 pandemic has dramatically impacted lives across the globe and will have lasting effects for years to come. How can we as archaeologists reflect on these changes and inform our understanding of their implications for the future? If we are to understand how to properly address this situation or future ones like it, we need to consider the implications of connectedness on multiple scales, that is, interactions and exchanges between people, groups, societies, and states across the globe. Can we use the past to gain new insights on how to act during and after a pandemic?
