subtitle: Opinion piece on the future after COVID-19 for the "Call for Inspiration" from the Jonge Academie
summary: Our world has been hit in its very core. The connectivity that so characterises our modern world, is also one of the drivers of the pandamic that wanders through our society. Can we rethink this connectivity in a way that it addresses this brave new world? And can we use a historical lens to aid this rethinking?

The Covid-19 pandemic has dramatically impacted lives across the globe and will likely have lasting effects for years to come. Changes will be most profound in the ways we conduct our day-to-day interactions with other people. How can we as scientists reflect on these changes, and inform our understanding of its implications? As archaeologists and historians, our first inclination is to look at the past for inspiration and guidance.  
But is this necessarily a useful approach? In any historical comparison, it is essential to distinguish similarities and differences, as well as to try and uncover the underlying drivers of these events. One could argue that the current event is so significantly different from any other in the past that comparison will be moot, or at least shallow and uninformative. Still, this does not mean that a historical lens cannot be useful. In this opinion piece, I will not look at specific historical cases, but I will use the theories and methods of the historical sciences to interpret the current situation and provide insights for the future.
