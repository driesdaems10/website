This project studies polis formation and synoikismos in southwestern Anatolia (covering the ancient regions of Lycia, Pamphylia and Pisidia) during Achaemenid and Hellenistic times. It aims to identify all attestations of synoiksimos and critically compare these with the associated archaeological material. By cross-checking historical and archaeological evidence, we hope to identify potential archaeological proxies to identify and interpret these processes as part of a wider set of strategies in the interaction space between local communities and central government.
