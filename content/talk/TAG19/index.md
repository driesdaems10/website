abstract: In this paper I discuss social complexity and inequality, focusing on the development of communities and cities as complex adaptive systems, centred on key concepts of feedback, emergence and self-organization. The proposed conceptual model will be illustrated through a case-study of the emergence of central places and urban networks in Achaemenid and Hellenistic Anatolia.
