abstract: In this paper, we will explore human-environment interactions in the area of Sagalassos from Iron Age to early Hellenistic times. We build an agent-based model to explore subsistence and resource exploitation strategies and test our hypothesis that the Iron Age hill-top sites in the area of Sagalassos can be considered major drivers of environmental change.
