## Course goals

The goal of this course is to introduce the student to the emerging field of Digital Archaeology, its history, current possibilities and limitations, and future potential. Besides providing a general theoretical understanding of what Digital Archaeology is all about, the course also aims to provide hands-on practice in various methods and techniques related to the application of digital tools in archaeology. Beyond theoretical understanding and hands-on practice, the main purpose of the course is to instil the student with a mindset of problem-solving and developing habits of thought geared towards the opportunities of applying digital tools and technologies in the field of archaeology. This mindset goes beyond the practical understanding of a limited amount of specific tools to perform a fixed set of tasks, but rather serves to gain an understanding of how to address problems in creative ways, using digital technologies.

## Course overview

Archaeology has always been a hands-on discipline. Those who are not willing to get their hand dirty in excavation or survey activities are often considered mere ‘armchair archaeologists’. Yet, modern archaeology entails so much more than digging and fieldwalking. To fully unlock the potential of the archaeological evidence, we can no longer ignore the potential of digital tools and technologies. Digital archaeology offers a myriad of opportunities to enhance, complement and extend traditional fieldwork and research activities.  
This course is all about introducing the student to the potential and opportunities of digital technologies in all steps of the archaeological process. During this course, we consider questions such as: How can digital technologies improve data collection during excavation and/or survey activities? How should we store and manage data in digital form? Can we use digital means to improve collaborative efforts among archaeologists? What is the added value of digital approaches in analysing archaeological data? How do you even do that? And yes, even how can we make archaeology a better discipline using digital means and technologies?  
Throughout this course, the student will gain a set of skills related to modelling, analysing, visualising and interpreting digital archaeological data with digital means. Beyond these practical skills, the main purpose of the course will be to instil a way of thinking and reflection geared towards digital approaches to archaeology. Gaining habits of thought is not so much about learning particular skills, but rather a mindset of trial and error in the face of potential hurdles for progress. The course is designed to stimulate jumping these hurdles. The course will cover all phases of archaeological data cycles: data capture, analysis, management, storage and publication. While we will use digital tools to progress in our goals, this course does not require any technical skills or abilities as prerequisites in order to succeed. Far more important is a diligent, open and creative mindset.  
The course will consist of introductory lectures to provide an overview and supporting context for personal exploration. These lectures are supplemented with a series of readings, assignments and tutorials to transfer knowledge, skills, and stimulate personal growth. Students will discuss these readings and assignment to improve collective understanding. Tentative assignments and readings will be communicated at the start of the course. These can change as the course progresses in function of the learning content.  
The first half of the course will focus on the general principles of Digital Archaeology, its history, theory and implications for all stages of the research cycle. In the second half of the course, these general principles will be applied in specific methodological approaches to Digital Archaeology. These practical applications will consist of a general introduction by the lecturer, a tutorial, readings and discussion. For every topic discussed in class, one or more students (depending on total number) will be assigned to summarise the readings and guide the discussion. Throughout the course, students will be asked to peer-evaluate assignments or exercises from fellow students.  

## Learning outcomes
* Gain an understanding of what is digital archaeology and how to situate it in the wider historiography of the discipline
* Learn about the role of digital tools and technologies in the archaeological practice
* Gain basic understanding of some tools and applications of digital technologies in archaeological research
* Instil habits of thought related to digital archaeology
* Understand the opportunities and potential of digital approaches for the future of archaeology

## Evaluation
30% final paper; 30% assignments; 20% active participation in class discussions; 10% peer-evaluation of assignment; 10% original contribution to classes. Remember that preparation is necessary to be able to adequately participate in discussion or contribute original thoughts. Participation in discussion and evaluation of exercises is essential and counts strongly towards the final grade.

## Final papers
Students can chose any topic covered in this course, as well as other relevant topics that apply digital technologies to any phase of the archaeological process, or theorisation regarding the role of the digital in the archaeological discipline. Particular care should be awarded to demonstrate growth in habits of thought. Students are encouraged to explore a wide range of output media, including not only academic papers but also tutorials, blogs and websites. Titles and abstracts must be submitted for approval by mid-term. Modalities of the paper will be announced during the course.
