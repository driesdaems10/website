## Course overview

The aim of this course is to introduce students to the potential of agent-based modelling (ABM) as a primary technique for computational simulations. Simulation is a formal scientific method used to develop, compare and test hypotheses (as expressed in computational models). While the use of simulation has increased dramatically over the last few decades across many scientific disciplines, the approach remains limited in social sciences and humanities such as archaeology, mostly due to the technological barrier involving coding skills. The course will consist of weekly lectures and practical lab sessions (each 2 hours) aimed at introducing the general principles of ABM, as well as giving hands-on experience. Participation in the lab sessions is essential to be able to progress in the course. This course will help students become familiar with coding approaches, using the user-friendly ABM software of NetLogo for building, executing and analysing simulations. No prior coding abilities or other technical skills are required, as we will start from the very basics in NetLogo programming. More important than the usage of particular tools, is the aim to create a diligent and creative mindset of model thinking. This requires deep reflection and developing habits of thought, going through phases of trial and error. The course will be aimed in the first place at the students of the M.Sc. in Settlement Archaeology and M.Sc. in Digital Archaeology, but will also be highly relevant for students from other departments, especially those from the humanities and social sciences who have less experience with model-based thinking.

## Learning outcomes
After completing the course, students will have gained:
* A model-thinking mindset
* A broader understanding of modelling and simulation approaches in archaeology
* Basic coding skills necessary to work with and build computer simulations of complex social and natural systems
* Skills for developing conceptual models on any topic of interest
* Insight into ancient societies and other potential research interests through the lens of computational modelling


## Evaluation
Final project 50%; Lab work 30%; Attendance and participation 20%. The final paper/project consists of a simple model built by the student and an accompanying paper discussing its workings and relevance for an archaeological research question. The final project will be presented by the students in the last week. It is essential that students are present in class as much as possible, both for the lectures as the lab sessions in order to be able to cumulatively build their modelling experience and successfully complete the course. Participation in discussions is essential and counts strongly towards the final grade.
