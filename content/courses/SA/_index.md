## Course goals

The goal of this course is to teach students the basic principles of spatial analysis in archaeology, focusing particularly on the underlying rationale, as well as the theoretical and methodological implications of frequently applied techniques. This course will offer a theory-based approach to spatial analysis, discussing the various theories and methodologies used to study landscapes and spatial human behaviour in the past through readings, group discussion and reflections. By the end of the course, students are expected to be able to formulate research questions about the spatial aspect of archaeological data, draft a spatially aware research design, and critically assess the application of spatial analysis and the interpretation of its outputs.

## Course overview

The modules for this course each consist of a short introductory lecture followed by a discussion based on assigned readings in which students are expected to participate actively, express and elaborate their opinions. Readings will be assigned one week ahead. The first half of the course discusses the basics of spatial analysis, including its historical development, prevalent theoretical approaches, the methods of data collection, standards of statistical analysis, its integration with time as the main structuring dimensions of archaeological research and ways of visualisation. The second half of the course introduces a number of important spatial methodologies in archaeological research. Topics listed in the syllabus are tentative and subject to change as the course progresses.

## Learning outcomes
* Gain an overview of the breadth of possibilities for spatial analysis in archaeology
* Build understanding of the theoretical and methodological requirements and implications of particular spatial methodologies
* Learn to transform research hypotheses into viable theoretical and methodological frameworks in the application of spatial analysis in archaeological research


## Evaluation
50% final paper; 40% active participation and engagement in class discussions; 10% attendance. Remember that preparation is necessary to be able to adequately participate in discussion or contribute original thoughts. Participation in discussion and evaluation of exercises is essential and counts strongly towards the final grade.

## Final papers
The final assignment for this course involves a theoretical paper discussing the potential and pitfalls of spatial analysis in archaeology. Students can chose any topic covered in this course, as well as other relevant topics that apply to course contents or thesis topics of the student. Topics must be announced by mid-term.
