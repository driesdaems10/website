## Course goals

The goal of this course is to teach students the basic principles of GIS applications in archaeology, the theoretical implications of using GIS, and to provide hands-on experience with certain analytical techniques related to the study of human behaviour in the past, their settlements and the wider landscape.

## Course overview

Each weekly course module will consist of a two-hour theoretical part aimed at discussing and reflecting on the potential and limitations of GIS analysis in archaeology with demonstrations executed in the GIS software QGIS, followed by a two-hour practical hands-on session using the GIS software TNTmips. The usage of two software programs to support different parts of the course is deliberate and aimed at creating a mild ‘cognitive dissonance’ to encourage the student to look beyond the limitations of the individual ‘point and click’ software and focus on the underlying habits of thought and generate understanding of the conceptual principles behind each analytical technique. The theoretical parts will consist of an introductory lecture and demonstrations of spatial analysis methods followed by a discussion in which students are expected to participate actively, express and elaborate their opinions. Readings will be assigned one week ahead. The practical sessions will consist of tutorials and exercises aimed at gaining hands-on experience. We will focus on basic operations and analytical techniques in GIS that are frequently applied in archaeological projects and studies. Topics listed in the syllabus are tentative and subject to change as the course progresses.  
Please remember that this is an introductory course and that you cannot expect to become a GIS expert in the course of one semester. The aim of this course is to provide an overview of the possibilities of GIS technologies and provide the foundation for more complex/advanced applications that you can explore by yourself or in specialized courses.

## Evaluation
40% final paper; 40% lab work and project; 10% active participation in class; 10% attendance. Remember that preparation is necessary to be able to adequately participate in discussion or contribute original thoughts. Participation in discussion and evaluation of exercises is essential and counts strongly towards the final grade.

## Final papers
The final assignment for this course involves a paper, discussing the potential and pitfalls of GIS applications in current and future archaeology. The paper builds on what you have learned from both the theoretical and practical sessions. It needs to engage with the practical knowledge obtained from the lab work through a theoretical reflection on how to extend these basics towards some of the analytical approaches encountered during the theoretical sessions. Ideally, the paper represents a genuine thought exercise in how to include spatial data analysis in a real research project derived from your thesis work. If you do not yet have a thesis topic defined (or if your topic does not allow for spatial analysis) then think of a hypothetical scenario. Topics must be announced by mid-term. At the end of the course, students will present their work to the group.
